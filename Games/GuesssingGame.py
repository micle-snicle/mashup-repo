#In this chapter, youâ€™re going to make a
#Guess the Number game. The computer
#will think of a secret number from 1 to 20
#and ask the user to guess it. After each guess,
#the computer will tell the user whether the number is
#too high or too low. The user wins if they can guess
#the number within six tries.
